# SpeakerVerification
Speaker Verification system implemented in JAVA.

This speaker verification system uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and a Dynamic Time Warping algorithm to compute and compare features of an enrolled user to those of a user seeking verification.

# Usage

To be able to properly use this speaker verification system,
one needs to make sure they have access to a voice recording
device capable of producing PCM-encoded signal streams.
**Note: the PCM-encoding used must produce either IEEE float
      sequences of the sampled voice or IEEE double sequences.**
